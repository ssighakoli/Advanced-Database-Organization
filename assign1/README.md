## Assignment 1 - Storage Manager:

- The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple storage manager - a module that is capable of reading blocks from a file on disk into memory and writing blocks from memory to a file on disk.<br>
- The storage manager deals with pages (blocks) of fixed size (PAGE_SIZE). <br>
- In addition to reading and writing pages from a file, it provides methods for creating, opening, and closing files. <br>
- The storage manager has to maintain several types of information for an open file: The number of total pages in the file, the current page position (for reading and writing), the file name, and a POSIX file descriptor or FILE pointer. <br>
